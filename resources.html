            <b>Misconception: </b>There’s just one “type” of dementia. <br>
            <b>Correct Information: </b>There are many different types of dementia, including, but not limited to,
            Alzheimer’s dementia, Vascular Dementia and Dementia with Lewy bodies.<br><br>
            <b>Misconception: </b>Losing one’s memory is a natural part of ageing.<br>
            <b>Correct Information: </b>While dementia is common in the ageing population, it is not a normal or natural
            part of ageing.<br><br>
            <b>Misconception: </b>People with dementia all live in nursing homes or assisted living facilities, and
            are unable to communicate with others.<br>
            <b>Correct Information: </b>The progression of dementia due to Alzheimer’s is gradual, so many people with
            dementia may be out in the world. Some may even be living independently with moderate help.<br><br>
            <b>Misconception: </b>Dementia is genetic - if my family member has it, I will definitely get it too.<br>
            <b>Correct Information: </b>Some types of dementia have genetic links, but most dementia is not hereditary.
            The largest risk factor for dementia is still age.<br><br>
            <b>Misconception: </b>Dementia only affects old people.<br>
            <b>Correct Information: </b>Although older people (above 65) are much more likely to get dementia, it can
            affect people who are in their 30s, 40s, or 50s as well.<br><br>
            <b>Misconception: </b>Dementia is usually diagnosed shortly after the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.<br>
            <b>Correct Information: </b>Dementia-causing disease can be present as much as 20 years before symptoms of
            dementia begin to occur. The first signs of disease are often very mild forms of cognitive (learning or
            memory) impairment and may be too subtle to cause concern.<br><br>
            <b>Misconception: </b>Dementia signals the end of a meaningful life.<br>
            <b>Correct Information: </b>This is not the case as many people with a dementia diagnosis lead active,
            meaningful lives. As dementia worsens, changes to the way an individual leads their life are likely, but
            that does not mean that the person cannot lead a fulfilling life.<br><br>
            <b>Misconception: </b>Memory loss always signifies dementia.<br>
            <b>Correct Information: </b>Although memory loss can be an early symptom of dementia, it does not
            necessarily signify the start of this condition. Human memory can be unpredictable, and we all forget things
            occasionally. However, if memory loss is interfering with everyday life, it is best to speak with a
            doctor.<br><br>
            <b>Misconception: </b>People with dementia can't understand what's going on around them.<br>
            <b>Correct Information: </b>Each person's experience with dementia is different. No one should make any
            assumptions about a person with dementia's level of understanding without engaging with them first.<br><br>
            <b>Misconception: </b>Dementia only affects memory.<br>
            <b>Correct Information: </b>Dementia can affect various cognitive functions beyond memory, including
            language, problem-solving, attention, and orientation. People with dementia may experience difficulties with
            communication, decision-making, spatial awareness, and emotional regulation.

            3 experts conducted a survey in Norway regarding the needs of Dementia patients. They found that people with
            dementia participating in the study were heterogeneous regarding wants and requirements. Most of them
            expressed the need and wish to hold on to who they are. Close and robust relations with family and friends
            can give significant support to people with dementia. However, living with dementia might put considerable
            strain on relations. Services should provide support to enhance relationships, encourage existing networks
            to remain stable and facilitate participation in meaningful activities for people living with dementia
            (Telenius et al., 2020). Read more at: <a

            The National Neuroscience Institute reveals that Dementia hits most individuals who are 65 years and above.
            So the chances of getting dementia increase after you are 60 years old and above. While there is no definite
            cure, the progression of the disease slows down with better care and support. We should aim to develop
            dementia-friendly communities and incorporate integrated care for providing better support.<br><br>
            Today, one in 10 seniors who are aged 60 and above in Singapore has dementia. Neurological diseases such as
            dementia are the fifth leading cause of disability in Singapore. With increased life expectancy and a
            rapidly ageing population, we expect the number of people with dementia to increase. It is therefore
            important to raise awareness of dementia and increase support for persons with dementia and their
            caregivers. — Associate Professor Nagaendran Kandiah, Chairman, 13th Congress of the Asian Society Against
            Dementia<br><br>
            Three in four with the condition feel lonely and rejected, according to the survey conducted by Singapore
            Management University (SMU) and the Alzheimer's Disease Association (ADA). About 56 per cent of respondents
            feel that people treat those with dementia as less competent, based on the findings released on Monday
            (April 29). Nearly 30 per cent of caregivers feel embarrassed while caring for their loved ones with
            dementia in public. But 90 per cent of them do not think people with the condition are less competent. More
            than 5,600 people across Singapore, including those with dementia, caregivers and the public, participated
            in the study. Of the respondents, 32 had dementia, 1,156 were caregivers and 4,491 were not related to
            dementia patients. The study was conducted in January 2020 over five weeks. In terms of stigma levels, the
            results show that, unsurprisingly, those who hold no connection to dementia have the highest stigmatic
            attitude, according to ADA.

            The Caregivers’ Training Grant provides caregivers with $200 a year to attend courses that teach them how to
            better take care of their loved ones. It covers a wide variety of topics, including caring for those with
            dementia.<br><br>
            “My House of Memories” is an app jointly developed by Singapore's National Heritage Board, the National
            Museums Liverpool and British Council Singapore. This app is a digital resource specially designed to help
            seniors living with dementia unlock memories and improve communication with their caregivers. The Singapore
            version contains specially-curated images, descriptions and even sounds of familiar everyday items from the
            yesteryears. These serve as memory triggers and conversation starters to facilitate interaction between
            people with dementia and their caregivers. Users can also create personalised albums by uploading pictures
            of objects, people and places that are close to the hearts of the persons living with dementia.<br><br>
            CARA is a mobile app developed by Dementia Singapore in partnership with the Agency for Integrated Care, the
            National Council of Social Service and tech company Embreo, aims to help dementia patients seek out
            activities and programmes that will mentally stimulate them. The app also recommends dementia-friendly
            places to visit in Singapore. The app also has a safety feature. In the event that the person living with
            dementia forgets his/her way home, anyone can help alert the caregiver simply by scanning a QR code on the
            in-app e-membership card or physical card which can be displayed on the clothes or belongings of the
            dementia patient.<br><br>
            Singapore has been working towards creating dementia-friendly communities that are more understanding and
            supportive of individuals living with dementia. Various organisations, including the Alzheimer's Disease
            Association (ADA), have been actively promoting awareness and education to reduce stigma and increase
            understanding of dementia within the community. In addition, the Housing Development Board has started to
            repaint HDB blocks with distinctive colours and block numbers to help persons living with dementia
            differentiate between them, enhancing the ease with which they navigate the area.<br><br>
            Dementia-Friendly Infrastructure: Efforts have been made to make public spaces and buildings more accessible
            and dementia-friendly. This can include clear signage, uncluttered spaces, and other adjustments that can
            help people with dementia navigate their surroundings more easily. <br><br>
            National Dementia Strategy: Singapore's government has been actively working on a National Dementia Strategy
            to coordinate efforts across different sectors and ensure a comprehensive approach to dementia care and
            support. <br><br>
            Dementia Day Care Centers: Singapore has established day care centres specifically designed for people with
            dementia. These centres provide a safe and supportive environment for individuals with dementia, while also
            offering respite for their caregivers. <br><br>
            Research and Development: Singapore supports research and development efforts related to dementia, including
            studies on early detection, innovative care approaches, and potential treatments.

            “While the final chapter of my life with dementia may be trying, nothing has diminished my gratitude and
            deep appreciation for the countless blessings in my life.” — Sandra Day O’Connor <br><br>
            “Alzheimer’s is not about the past—the successes, the accolades, the accomplishments… Alzheimer’s is about
            the present and the struggle, the scrappy brawl, the fight to live with a disease. It’s being in the
            present, the relationships, the experiences, which is the core of life, the courage to live in the soul.” —
            Greg O’Brien <br><br>
            “Being able to achieve a goal or see that difference has increased my happiness and my self-respect because
            I’m proud of myself. I even tell my wife, “look at what I can do!” That feeling is priceless.” —Pete
            Middleton <br><br>
            We need a little bit of help, but I don’t think it’s communicated widely that yes, if you’ve got dementia,
            you can still have a life. — Annie Dow <br><br>
            “Please remember the real me when I cannot remember you.” -Spoken to her daughter by a mother who knew that
            Alzheimer’s was taking away her memories little by little.
